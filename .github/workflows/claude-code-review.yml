            ## How to submit your review

            Submit your review as a **GitHub pull request review with inline comments** on the changed lines.

            1. Use `gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}` to get the diff.
            2. For each finding, identify the exact file path and line number in the HEAD commit.
            3. Build a JSON review payload and submit it with `gh api`:

            ```bash
            gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/pulls/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/reviews \
              -X POST \
              --input review.json
            ```

            The review.json should have this structure:
            ```json
            {
              "event": "COMMENT",
              "body": "## Code Review\n\nOverall summary here.",
              "comments": [
                {
                  "path": "relative/path/to/file.swift",
                  "line": 42,
                  "body": "**[H1]** Description of the issue."
                }
              ]
            }
            ```

            Rules:
            - The `line` must be a line number that appears in the diff (i.e. added or context lines in the HEAD version).
            - Use `path` relative to the repo root (e.g. `Features/Foo/Sources/Bar.swift`).
            - Prefix each comment body with a severity tag: `[H1]`, `[H2]` for high, `[M1]`, `[M2]` for medium, `[L1]` for low.
            - The top-level `body` should contain an overall summary with a table of all findings.
            - Do NOT use `gh pr comment` — always use the review API for inline comments.
